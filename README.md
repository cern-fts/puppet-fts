#Puppet module for File Transfer Service

##Overview
Puppet module to configure the FTS (File Transfer Service) version 3.
For general configuration guide to the FTS see:

https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/fts3/wiki/AdminGuide

##Setup
###Setup Requirements
* This configuration assumes a RHEL6 like distribution.
* The puppetlabs-firewall module is used and must be available
* The puppetlabs(or cprice404)-inifile module is used and must be avilable.
* The cernops-fetchcrl module is used.
* The cernops-voms modules is used.
* pluginsync must be enabled in puppet since this module uses ruby providers.
* host keys must be availble in the typical location
  /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem and hostkey.

###Usage

Enable the FTS service with 

     include('fts')

All the standard settings can be set via hiera calls in the parmas.pp file. See that
file for details. In particular this is where database connection parameters are set.

There are two extra defined types both based on inifile provider.

     fts3config{'/DbThreadsnNum': value => '100'} 

will edit a value in /etc/fts3/fts3config

     fts3restcofnig{'server:main/port': value => '20000'}

can be used to set a value in /etc/fts3/fts3rest.ini
